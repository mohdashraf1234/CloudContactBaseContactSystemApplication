# Cloud Based Contact System

In this project, we can store contact numbers or any other data on the cloud, and we can access it from anywhere. I created this project using Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, Thymeleaf, Spring Data JPA, DevTools, Hibernate, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap

### Installation
Here are the step-by-step instructions to run your this project in Eclipse STS (Spring Tool Suite):

1.Open Eclipse STS: Launch the Eclipse STS IDE.

2.Import Project: If you haven't already imported your project into Eclipse STS, you can do so by following these steps:

Go to File > Import. Select Existing Gradle Project or Existing Maven Project, depending on your project setup. Browse to the directory where your project is located. Select your project's root directory and click Finish. 3.Wait for Build: Let Eclipse STS build your project. This may take some time, especially if it's the first time you're importing the project.

4.Resolve Dependencies: Ensure that all dependencies are resolved. You can do this by checking the Problems view in Eclipse STS. If there are any missing dependencies or errors, you may need to resolve them by adding necessary dependencies to your pom.xml (if using Maven).

5.Set up Database Configuration: Make sure your MySQL database is running. If you haven't configured your database connection yet, you may need to set up the database configuration in your Spring Boot application properties (application.properties or application.yml) to connect to your MySQL database.

6.Run Application: Right-click on your Spring Boot application class (the one annotated with @SpringBootApplication) or the main class of your application, then select Run As > Spring Boot App or Java Application depending on your setup.

7.Access Application: Once the application is running, you should be able to access it through a web browser. By default, Spring Boot applications run on localhost on port 8080, so you can access your application by navigating to http://localhost:8080 in your web browser.

That's it! Your Spring Boot project should now be running in Eclipse STS. Make sure to test your application thoroughly to ensure everything is working as expected. If you encounter any issues, check the console output in Eclipse STS for any error messages and troubleshoot accordingly.
